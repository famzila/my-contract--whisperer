   * - Uses pre-defined mock contract analysis data
   * - No need for Chrome Canary or Built-in AI flags
   * - Instant results with realistic delay (1.5s)
   * - Perfect for UI development and testing

   * Analysis Strategy: Progressive Schema-Based (Default & Only Approach)
   * 
   * âœ… Features:
   * - Schema-based extraction with responseConstraint (100% reliable JSON parsing)
   * - Three-tier progressive loading for optimal UX:
   *   â€¢ Tier 1: Metadata (~1s) - Dashboard shows immediately
   *   â€¢ Tier 2: Summary + Risks (parallel ~2-3s) - High priority content
   *   â€¢ Tier 3: Obligations + Omissions + Questions (parallel ~2-3s) - Supporting details
   * - Lucide icons for better visual representation
   * - Per-section skeleton loaders and error handling
   * - Perceived performance: ~1s (instead of 10s wait)
   * 
   * ðŸŽ¯ This is now the default and only implementation.
   * Legacy approaches have been removed for code simplicity and maintainability.
