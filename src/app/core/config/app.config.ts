   * - Uses pre-defined mock contract analysis data
   * - No need for Chrome Canary or Built-in AI flags
   * - Instant results with realistic delay (1.5s)
   * - Perfect for UI development and testing

   * Analysis Strategy: RxJS Streaming (Default & Only Approach)
   * 
   * âœ… Features:
   * - Schema-based extraction with responseConstraint (100% reliable JSON parsing)
   * - RxJS streaming analysis for optimal UX:
   *   â€¢ Metadata priority (must complete first) - Dashboard shows immediately
   *   â€¢ Independent section streaming - Summary, Risks, Obligations, Omissions stream as they complete
   *   â€¢ No waiting for grouped tiers - each section displays as soon as it's ready
   * - Lucide icons for better visual representation
   * - Per-section skeleton loaders and error handling
   * - Perceived performance: ~1s (instead of 10s wait)
   * - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
   * 
   * ðŸŽ¯ This is now the default and only implementation.
   * Legacy approaches have been removed for code simplicity and maintainability.
