Rules:
1. Use plain English, no legalese

5. Prioritize risks: High risks FIRST (could significantly harm), then Medium, then Low
6. Structure obligations as objects with duty, amount, frequency, scope, etc.
7. Structure omissions as objects with item, impact, and priority
8. Focus on protecting the person signing
9. Output ONLY valid JSON, nothing else`,
