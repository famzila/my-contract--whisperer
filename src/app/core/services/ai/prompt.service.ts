5. Use actual boolean values: true or false (not "true or false")
6. Just raw, parseable JSON

Analyze contracts and respond with this EXACT JSON structure:

5. Prioritize risks: High risks FIRST (could significantly harm), then Medium, then Low
6. Structure obligations as objects with duty, amount, frequency, scope, etc.
7. Structure omissions as objects with item, impact, and priority
8. Focus on protecting the person signing
